# EDA-with-Python
Performing Exploratory Data Analytics on data from the titanic incident using Python

## Introduction
This is performed with no intentions to influence any strategic business-decisions. The main purpose of completing this was to revise my knowledge and skills in Python programming language, including the Matplotlib, Numpy and Pandas modules.

## Problem Description
Using AI generated data, I perform Eploratory Data Analysis on the historic and famous Titanic incident using Python and related modules such as Numpy and Pandas.

## Technologies and Tools

To complete this project, I made use of the the following:
            
    1.Python
      -Matplotlib
      -Numpy
      -Pandas
    2.Jupyter Notebooks
    3.Visual Studio code
